Project Overview
This project analyzes historical wildfire data from California to predict the risk level of wildfire incidents (Low, Medium, High) using machine learning models. Through careful data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and training classification models like Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, the project aims to support disaster planning and emergency response strategies.
